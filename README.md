# MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT: ASTEROIDS CLASSIFICATION
### Group 11: Alessandro Scicluna, Ignazio Leonardo Scarpelli, Lorenzo Carucci

## Introduction
In this project, the most famous space program agency in the world gave us the very important task of gaining insights on the characteristics of some NEO (Near Earth Objects) which can potentially hit the Earth. To do so, the agency provided us with a dataset which includes more than four thousand different NEOs observed between 1995 and 2016 together with their respective data. Our goal is to build a model that can predict, following some patterns and trends in the data, if an asteroyd could be or not dangerous for ourself.
